This angularjs module is part of the bankapp https://github.com/pussinboots/bankapp.
The idea is to store encrypted data in a backend and decode it on the client side so that the backend 
doesn't know what kind of data it stores only the angularjs client and the storage process know the 
plain data.

If you have question or want to take of the development than write me a mail at pussinboots666@googlemail.com.

It is a very young project but with the support of wide open source tools like karma and travis it
will flow soon i hope.
